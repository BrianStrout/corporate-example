                  7 reasons why organizational culture is important 1. It
                  defines your company’s internal and external identity Here’s a
                  thought exercise: write down on a piece of paper five
                  attributes that best describe your organization’s culture. You
                  might write something like “good work-life balance” or “lots
                  of meetings” or maybe “team-oriented.” Now, spend a few
                  minutes thinking about why each of those attributes is
                  important to your organization in particular. Why is it
                  significant that your company has a good work-life balance?
                  What makes these culture attributes valuable to your people
                  and customers? Peter Ashworth explains that your
                  organizational culture “defines for you and for all others,
                  how your organization does business, how your organization
                  interacts with one another and how the team interacts with the
                  outside world, specifically your customers, employees,
                  partners, suppliers, media and all other stakeholders.” In
                  other words, your organizational culture will reverberate
                  across all aspects of your business because it represents the
                  way you do business. It’s simultaneously your identity and
                  your image, which means it determines how your people and
                  customers perceive you. 2. Organizational culture is about
                  living your company’s core values Your culture can be a
                  reflection (or a betrayal) of your company’s core values. The
                  ways in which you conduct business, manage workflow, interact
                  as a team, and treat your customers all add up to an
                  experience that should represent who you are as an
                  organization and how you believe a company should be run. In
                  short, your culture is the sum of your company’s beliefs in
                  action. But if your espoused values don’t match your culture,
                  that’s a problem. It could mean that your “core values” are a
                  list of meaningless buzzwords, and your people know it. A
                  strong organizational culture keeps your company’s core values
                  front and center in all aspects of its day-to-day operations
                  and organizational structure. The value of doing so is
                  incalculable. 3. Your culture can transform employees into
                  advocates (or critics) One of the greatest advantages of a
                  strong organizational culture is that it has the power to turn
                  employees into advocates. Your people want more than a steady
                  paycheck and good benefits; they want to feel like what they
                  do matters. And when your people feel like they matter,
                  they’re more likely to become culture advocates—that is,
                  people who not only contribute to your organization’s culture,
                  but also promote it and live it internally and externally. How
                  do you achieve this? One way is to recognize good work. A
                  culture that celebrates individual and team successes, that
                  gives credit when credit is due, is a culture that offers a
                  sense of accomplishment. And that’s one way to turn employees
                  into advocates. Then again, if your company culture doesn’t do
                  this, you may be inviting criticism. 4. A strong
                  organizational culture helps you keep your best people It
                  should come as no surprise that employees who feel like
                  they’re part of a community, rather than a cog in a wheel, are
                  more likely to stay at your company. In fact, that’s what most
                  job applicants are looking for in a company. Ask any top
                  performer what keeps them at their company and you’re bound to
                  hear this answer: the people. It’s because a workplace culture
                  focused on people has profound appeal. It helps improve
                  engagement, deliver a unique employee experience, and makes
                  your people feel more connected. One way to attract top
                  performers that are natural culture champions is to hire for
                  cultural fit. Want to learn how to build a strong
                  organizational culture? 5. A well-functioning culture assists
                  with onboarding Organizational culture also has the potential
                  to act as an aligning force at your company. This is
                  particularly the case with new hires who, more often than not,
                  have put some considerable thought into the type of culture
                  they’re entering into. The culture at your organization is
                  essentially a guiding force for them, so it’s important that
                  it starts with onboarding. Writing in Forbes, George Bradt
                  explains further: “People fail in new jobs because of poor
                  fit, poor delivery or poor adjustment to changes down the
                  road. Assuming you’ve aligned the organization around the need
                  for your new employees and acquired them in the right way,
                  your onboarding program should accommodate their needs (so
                  they can do real work), assimilate them into the organization
                  (so they fit culturally) and accelerate their progress (so
                  they can deliver and adjust).” 6. Your culture transforms your
                  company into a team A successful organizational culture brings
                  together the people at your company and keeps them aligned.
                  When your culture is clear, different perspectives can gather
                  behind it with common purpose. The culture at your
                  organization sets expectations for how people behave and work
                  together, and how well they function as a team. In this way,
                  culture can break down the boundaries between siloed teams,
                  guide decision-making, and improve workflow overall. On the
                  flip side, a toxic organizational culture has the capacity to
                  do just the opposite. 7. Culture impacts performance and
                  employee wellbeing Reports show that organizational culture
                  has a direct impact on performance and, more importantly, your
                  employees’ wellbeing. A healthy culture addresses both of
                  these areas by finding an appropriate balance based on company
                  values. Does your company stress performance to such a degree
                  that you feel like your physical and mental health are being
                  overlooked? There might be instances when that may not be a
                  problem, but for the vast majority of cases, it’ll have a
                  negative effect on your company. Paul Barrett sums it up
                  nicely, writing that “Employee wellbeing strategies have the
                  potential to bring huge benefits to employees and employers
                  alike but they need to be introduced in the right way for the
                  right reasons, and at the right time. To be properly effective
                  they need to be developed in a holistic way, consistent with a
                  business culture that is conducive to their success. That
                  means supportive management behaviours, flexible working
                  options and an open culture that allows employees a voice and
                  some say in shaping the working environment.”
